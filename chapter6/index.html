<h3 id="question-1">Can an id have more than one word?</h3>
Yes, your ids can have more than one word as long as there are no spaces. Separate each word with a dash instead.
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="question-2">Can visitors bookmark anchor links?</h3>
Yes, they can! And when they visit that link, the browser will jump down to the anchor as expected. Visitors can share the link with others, too, so all the more reason to choose meaningful anchor names.

<h3 id="question-3"> My anchor link isn't working. What am I doing wrong?</h3>
A: The problem could be a few things. Firs, double-check that you added an id (without "#") to the element your link should point to. Also, be sure that the anchor in your link is preceded by "#" and that it matches the anchor id.

    <h1>Learning Article & Aside in Chapter 3</h1>
    <p>This exercise is in Chapter 3 of our HTML and CSS textbook to practice the <strong>article</strong> element as well as the <strong>aside</strong> element.
        <h2>Article and Aside</h2>
        The article tag can be used to contain content like a newspaper article. Other examples of are movie reviews, case studies,a product description, etc. You can nest articles as long as they contain related content. A webpage can have many article tags.
        Sometimes you may want to add a little textbox on the sidebar containing links or a quote or many other options, this would be done as an aside. 
        It is common to think of an aside as a sidebar. It can be a sidebar, but you can place an aside element in a variety of places in your webpage. You can apply CSS styles to have the aside appear alongside the main content instead of below it. You can nest it within the primary content of your page. In my opinion, it is more astetically pleasing as a sticky note style sidebar on the webpage.

        <h3>Title for <u>aside</u> sub-section</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>With CSS this can be a small textbox beside your content.</li>
            <li>An aside can contain a quote or list of links to other <strong>related</strong> info.  </li>
            <li>"Related quote to article," Jessie.</li>
